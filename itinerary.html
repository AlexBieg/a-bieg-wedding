                    Canlis opens at 5, so you may need to wait if you arrive earlier. Canlis does offer
                    valet parking, but if you are planning on drinking we would encourage you to to use a
                    rideshare service or taxi. The Ceremony and Reception will be held up the stairs to the
                    right when you enter.
